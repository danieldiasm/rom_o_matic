# ROM-O-Matic

## The ROM scraper and downloader

<br>

### Description

This is a tool for scraping available game titles and automatic downloading from most common and open to public websites.

<br>

### Purpose

This basically came as a learning project of webscraping, I've aimed on ROM websites to have something fun and relatively complex.

<br>

### How it works

Basically the tool will iterate over certain websites collecting available titles and add them to a database, reporting to you all the available titles to be downloaded.

After you mark all the ones you want downloaded, the tool will download them for you and mark as downloaded on the list, making it possible to stop the download and continue later.
